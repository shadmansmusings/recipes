Directions:

1. Heat olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add onions to pan; sauté
   for 5 minutes or until tender. Stir in sugar, pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon salt.
   Reduce heat to medium; cook 20 minutes, stirring frequently. Increase heat to
   medium-high, and sauté for 5 minutes or until onion is golden brown. Stir in
   wine, and cook for 1 minute. Add broth and thyme; bring to a boil. Cover,
   reduce heat, and simmer 2 hours.

2. Preheat broiler.

3. Place bread in a single layer on a baking sheet; broil 2 minutes or until
   toasted, turning after 1 minute.

   Divide bread evenly among bowls; top each serving with 1 cheese slice. Broil
   3 minutes or until cheese begins to brown.
